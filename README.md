Hello, welcome to the repo for my work-in-progress UK power generation dashboard.

Here, you can find the power-gen.ipynb notebook which houses the Python code that I ran the API call to National Grid's website to pull, clean and save the data as a csv.
You can also find the html, css and javascript codes that make up the site itself (https://irfanmjaafar.github.io/test/). The css files are located in the styles folder.
The current-powe-gen.csv is the example of csv file that would be downloaded from the Python script.
